CSR: Good morning, thank you for calling ShiokAh Insurance. This is Sarah speaking. How may I help you today?

Customer: Hi ah, I want to enquire about travel insurance. Planning to go Japan next month.

CSR: I'll be happy to help you with that. Before we look at the options, could you share some information about yourself and your travel plans?

Customer: Can, can. What you need to know?

CSR: Let me start with your age, please?

Customer: I'm 62 this year.

CSR: Thank you. And do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that we should take into account?

Customer: Yes... I have high blood pressure and diabetes. Both under control lah, but still need to take medicine every day.

CSR: I understand. Thank you for sharing that. How long are you planning to stay in Japan?

Customer: Around two weeks. Going during sakura season, from March 25 to April 8.

CSR: Got it. When it comes to coverage, what matters most to you? For example, some travelers prioritize medical coverage, while others focus more on travel-related issues like flight delays or lost baggage.

Customer: Wah, actually quite worried about the medical part lah. Because I heard Japan hospital very expensive. But also want to make sure got cover for my luggage. Going to buy quite a lot of omiyage for my family.

CSR: I see. For medical coverage, could you tell me what level of coverage you're thinking about? And for luggage, would you be carrying any high-value items?

Customer: For medical, I don't know leh... Maybe you can explain what different levels mean?

CSR: Of course. For example, basic medical coverage might cover up to $50,000, while comprehensive coverage could go up to $250,000 or more. This would include things like hospital stays, emergency treatment, and medical evacuation if needed.

Customer: Oh like that ah... Then better get higher coverage. Don't want to take risk. For luggage, nothing too expensive, just normal clothes and some electronics like my phone and camera.

CSR: Thank you for that information. Now, regarding policy customization, would you be interested in any specific activities in Japan that might need special coverage? For example, winter sports or hiking?

Customer: No lah, nothing so adventurous. Just normal sightseeing, shopping, maybe go onsen. Oh ya, speaking of onsen, my blood pressure sometimes not so stable when it's too hot. Is this something I should consider?

CSR: Yes, that's important information, thank you for mentioning it. Just to summarize your coverage priorities: medical coverage is your top concern, followed by baggage protection. Is that correct?

Customer: Yes, correct. And if possible, want to make sure got good coverage for trip cancellation also. You know nowadays everything so uncertain.

CSR: I understand completely. Just one last question - would you be traveling alone or with companions?

Customer: Going with my wife. She's 60, no medical conditions. Should we get separate policies or can get together?

CSR: Thank you for mentioning that. I've now gathered all the necessary information about your requirements. Would you like me to explain how our policies are structured for couples?

Customer: Yes please.

CSR: Let me get our policy specialist to walk you through the available options that match your requirements. Please hold while I transfer your call.
