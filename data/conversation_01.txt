CSR: Good morning! Thank you for calling ShiokAh Insurance. My name is Sarah. How may I assist you today?

Customer: Hi Sarah! I want to check about travel insurance leh. Planning to go Japan next month.

CSR: I'll be happy to help you with that. Before we look into the options, could you share some information with me? May I know your age?

Customer: I'm 62 this year.

CSR: Thank you for sharing. Since you're above 60, we'll need to note this for coverage considerations. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that we should be aware of?

Customer: Ya, I have high blood pressure and diabetes. Both under control with medication. Been taking them for past 5 years.

CSR: I understand. When you say they're under control, have you had any hospitalizations related to these conditions in the past 12 months?

Customer: No lah, no hospitalization. Just regular checkup every 3 months at polyclinic.

CSR: That's helpful to know. Now, you mentioned Japan. How long will you be staying there?

Customer: Going for 2 weeks. From 15th to 29th December. Winter season, you know.

CSR: Ah, winter travel. Will you be doing any winter sports activities like skiing or snowboarding?

Customer: No skiing lah. But want to visit Mount Fuji and go for onsen. Maybe do some light hiking also.

CSR: I see. For activities like hiking, even light ones, we'll need to note that down. Are you traveling alone or with family members?

Customer: Going with my wife. She's 60, no medical condition. Should we get separate policies or can cover together?

CSR: I understand you're interested in coverage for both you and your wife. Let me ask about other coverage factors. What are your main concerns regarding the insurance coverage?

Customer: Aiyah, mainly worried about medical emergencies ba. Winter time, don't want to take risk. Also want to cover if flight delay or luggage lost. And if need to cancel trip how?

CSR: I understand your concerns. For clarity, when you mention medical emergencies, are you looking for coverage that includes:
1. Emergency medical evacuation
2. Hospital daily cash benefit
3. Outpatient treatment
Could you specify which aspects are most important to you?

Customer: All also important lah. But evacuation most important. If anything happen in rural area how?

CSR: Understood. Last few questions about customization preferences. Would you prefer a higher excess amount to reduce premium, or would you rather pay more for premium to have a lower excess? For example, an excess of $100 means you pay the first $100 of any claim.

Customer: Prefer lower excess lah. Better peace of mind. Don't want to think so much if need to claim.

CSR: Thank you for sharing all this information. I have noted down:
- Your age (62) and your wife's age (60)
- Your medical conditions (controlled hypertension and diabetes)
- Destination: Japan for 2 weeks in winter
- Activities: Light hiking and general sightseeing
- Priority coverage areas: Medical evacuation, flight delays, trip cancellation
- Preference for lower excess amount

Would there be anything else you'd like to share about your requirements?

Customer: No lah, that's all. Can recommend some suitable plans or not?

CSR: I'll have our system process all these requirements and send you a detailed email with suitable plans for your consideration. Could I have your email address?
