      "\n",
      "Income's Travel Insurance provides comprehensive travel coverage with various plans (Classic, Deluxe, Preferred). Key policy highlights include coverage for trip cancellation, medical expenses, emergency medical evacuation, travel delay, and adventurous activities. Notably, standard plans do not cover pre-existing medical conditions, but the Enhanced PreX Travel Insurance offers this option. The policy covers leisure activities like hiking and scuba diving, subject to safety guidelines and certain conditions.\n",

      "## Age\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Customer Age**: 62\n",
      "- **Policy Implication**: The policy specifies different coverage limits for individuals aged 70 or older and those under 70. At 62, the customer is considered under 70, allowing access to higher coverage limits in several sections, including personal accident and medical expenses benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Medical Conditions\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Customer Medical Conditions**: High blood pressure, diabetes (controlled with medication).\n",
      "- **Policy Consideration**: Standard plans do not cover pre-existing medical conditions. Coverage options for medical emergencies abroad, up to $1,000,000 under the Preferred plan, are valuable. If medical conditions trigger costs, the customer needs to consider the Enhanced PreX Travel Insurance for additional coverage specific to pre-existing conditions.\n",

      "\n",
      "- **Destination**: Japan\n",
      "- **Duration**: 2 weeks (15th December - 29th December)\n",

      "- **Policy Implication**: Hiking is covered under the adventurous activities option provided it follows safety guidelines. The couple is traveling with a spouse without medical conditions, making joint policy applications likely eligible for spouse or family plans, enabling potential savings on premiums.
